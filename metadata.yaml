description: Emerson Hough made his name as a writer of Westerns, but the frontier
  lawyer also had a keen interest in the rough tapestry of American history as a whole.
  In this historical novel, he details the remarkable life of Scottish economist John
  Law, who put his controversial business ideas to work in Mississippi and Louisiana
  and caused a financial mess so profound that he had to flee the region disguised
  as a female traveler to preserve his own safety.
